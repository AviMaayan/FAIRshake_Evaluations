The program is orientated towards (strict and relaxed) molecular clock analyses. It can be used as a method of constructing phylogenies, but it is also intended for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability.

The genomic contexts are determined with a multiple center star clustering topology on the basis of a user-provided protein sequence and all (or a set of) chromosomes from the publicly available archaeal and bacterial genomes. The results consist in a dynamic web page where a consistent color coding permits a rapid visual evaluation of the relative positioning of homologous genes within the synteny. Each gene composing the synteny can be further queried interactively using either local or remote databases. Absynte results can be exported in .CSV or high resolution .PDF formats for printing, archival, further editing or publication purposes.

Description: Evolutionary information in the form of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) is a widely used and highly informative representation of protein sequences. Accordingly, PSSM-based feature descriptors have been successfully applied to improve the performance of various predictors of protein attributes. Even though a number of algorithms have been proposed in previous studies, there is currently no universal web server or toolkit available for generating this wide variety of descriptors. Here, we present POSSUM (Position-Specific Scoring matrix-based feature generator for machine learning), a versatile toolkit with an online web server that can generate 21 types of PSSM-based feature descriptors, thereby addressing a crucial need for bioinformaticians and computational biologists. We envisage that this comprehensive toolkit will be widely used as a powerful tool to facilitate feature extraction, selection, and benchmarking of machine learning-based models, thereby contributing to a more effective analysis and modeling pipeline for bioinformatics research.

1989,1989,12,969,1,yes,http://hymenopteragenome.org/,"Name: Hymenoptera Genome Database (HGD). Description: The Hymenoptera Genome Database (HGD) is a genome informatics resource that supports the research of insects of the order Hymenoptera (e.g. bees, wasps, ants). HGD is divided into three main divisions: BeeBase, which hosts bee genomes and the Bee Pests and Pathogens resource; NasoniaBase, which hosts the genome of the Jewel wasp (Nasonia vitripennis); and the Ant Genomes Portal, which hosts the genomes of several ant species.

HGD provides tools for data mining (HymenopteraMine), sequence searching (BLAST), genome browsing (JBrowse), genome annotation (Apollo) and data download. HymenopteraMine and BLAST are shared across all three HGD divisions, while JBrowse, Apollo and data download pages are specific to each division.
HymenopteraMine is the newest HGD resource. HymenopteraMine is a data mining tool that integrates all of the genomes in HGD with biological data from a variety of sources. The goal of HymeopteraMine is to accelerate genomics analysis by enabling researchers without scripting skills to create and export customized annotation datasets merged with their own research data for use in downstream analyses. HymenopteraMine facilitates cross-species data mining based on orthology and supports meta-analyses by tracking identifiers across gene sets and genome assemblies.",1,test,1,1,The tool has a unique name and an informative description.,F,,,R,Tool,test,zhuorui.xie@mssm.edu,Zhuorui,,Xie,test,"Ma'ayan Lab, ISMMS",0000-0002-8256-5878,Hymenoptera Genome Database,http://HymenopteraGenome.org,Tool,Integrated community resources for insect species of the order Hymenoptera,1,test

Description: In microbiome analyses, often rRNA gene databases are used to assign taxonomic names to sequence reads. The TaxMan server facilitates the analysis of the taxonomic distribution of your reads in two ways. First, you can check what taxonomic names are assigned to the sequences produced by your primers and what taxa you will lose. Second, the produced amplicon sequences with lineages in the FASTA header can be downloaded. This can result in a much more efficient analysis with respect to run time and memory usage, since the amplicon sequences are considerably shorter than the full length rRNA gene sequences. In addition, you can download a lineage file that includes the counts of all taxa for your primers and for the used reference.

We have preprocessed the databases so that they now all include the taxonomic lineage in the FASTA header.

These peptides have wide range of function and therapeutic activities, here we classified these peptides into 10 categories based on their major function. These categories includes anticancer, antiviral, antiparasite, antibacterial, drug delivery and toxic peptides. In addition to main categories, we also assigned sub-categories to peptides belongs to certain peptide categories; for examples toxic peptides were further classified into cytotoxic and hemolytic peptides. It has been shown in past that structure of peptide is responsible to its function. Thus we predicted or annotated structure of peptides in SATPdb using state-of-art techniques and Protein Data Bank (PDB).

TopFD (Top-down mass spectral Feature Detection) is a software tool for top-down spectral deconvolution and a successor to MS-Deconv. It groups top-down spectral peaks into isotopomer envelopes and converts isotopomer envelops to monoisotopic neutral masses. In addition, it extracts proteoform features from MS1 spectra.
TopPIC (Top-down mass spectrometry based Proteoform Identification and Characterization) identifies and characterizes proteoforms at the whole proteome level by searching top-down tandem mass spectra against a protein sequence database. TopPIC is a successor to MS-Align+. It efficiently identifies proteoforms with unexpected alterations, such as mutations and post-translational modifications (PTMs), accurately estimates statistical significance of identifications, and characterizes reported proteoforms with unknown mass shifts. It uses several techniques, such as indexes, spectral alignment, generation function methods, and the modification identification score (MIScore) to increase its speed, sensitivity, and accuracy.

MSIsensor is a C++ program to detect replication slippage variants at microsatellite regions, and differentiate them as somatic or germline. Given paired tumor and normal sequence data, it builds a distribution for expected (normal) and observed (tumor) lengths of repeated sequence per microsatellite, and compares them using Pearson's Chi-Squared Test. Comprehensive testing indicates MSIsensor is an efficient and effective tool for deriving MSI status from standard tumor-normal paired sequence data. Since there are many users complained that they don't have paired normal sequence data or related normal sequence data can be used to build a paired normal control, we released MSIsensor V0.3. Given tumor only sequence data, it uses comentropy theory and figures out a comentropy value for a distribution per microsatellite. Our test results show that it's performance is comparable with paired tumor and normal sequence data input. We suggest msi score cutoff 11% for tumor only data.

Further, it has been shown that, if the inherent experimental noise is considered, many different logical networks can be compatible with a set of experimental observations. Thus, automated inference of logical networks from experimental data would allow for identifying admissible large-scale logic models saving a lot of efforts and without any a priori bias. Next, once a family a logical networks has been identified, one can suggest or design new experiments in order to reduce the uncertainty provided by this family. Finally, one can look for intervention strategies that force a set of target species or compounds into a desired steady state. Altogether, this constitutes a pipeline for automated reasoning on logical signaling networks. Hence, the aim of caspo is to implement such a pipeline providing a powerful and easy-to-use software tool for systems biologists.",1,test,1,1,The tool has a unique name and an informative description.,F,,,R,Tool,test,vivek.sriram@mssm.edu,Vivek,,Sriram,test,"Ma'ayan Lab, ISMMS",0000-0003-3759-2911,caspo,http://github.com/bioasp/caspo,Tool,A toolbox for automated reasoning on the response of logical signaling networks families,1,test
